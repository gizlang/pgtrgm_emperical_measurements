# Measuring the performance of pg_trgm

This repository contains **extensive, verbose, detailed** information about the behavior of pg_trgm at large scales, particularly for regex search.

Before viewing this repository, you will likely prefer to read the blog post format first:

["Postgres regex search over 10,000 GitHub repositories"](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/postgres-regex-search-over-10000-github-repositories)

This repository shares how we performed our empirical measurements, for reproducibility by others.

## Overview

- `cmd/corpusindex` small Go program which bulk inserts the corpus into Postgres
- `cmd/githubscrape` small Go program that fetches the top 1,000 repositories for any language.
- `cmd/visualize-docker-json-stats` cleans up `docker_stats_logs/` output for visualization using [the jp tool](https://github.com/sgreben/jp).
- `docker_logs/` logs from the Docker container during execution.
- `docker_stats_logs/` logs from `docker stats` during indexing/querying the corpus, showing CPU/memory usage over time.
- `top_repos/` contains URLs to the top 1,000 repositories for a given language. In total, 20,578 repositories.
- `query_logs/` the Postgres SQL queries we ultimately ran.
- `capture-docker-stats.sh` captures `docker stats` output every 1s with timing info.
- `clone-corpus.sh` clones all 20,578 repositories (concurrently.)
- `extract-base-postgres-config.sh` extracts the base Postgres config from the Docker image.
- `index-corpus.sh` used to invoke the `corpusindex` tool for every repository, once cloned.
- `query-corpus.sh` runs detailed search queries over the corpus (invokes the other `query-corpus*` scripts.)
- `run-postgres.sh` runs the Postgres server Docker image.

## Cloning the corpus

First run `./clone_corpus.sh` to download the corpus into `../corpus` (it uses the parent directory, because VS Code and most tooling will barf if there is a directory that many files existing in a project.)

WARNING, this will:

* Clone all 20,578 repositories concurrently, using most of your available CPU/memory/network resources.
* Take 12-16 hours with a fast ~100 Mbps connection to GitHub's servers.
* Consumes ~265G of disk space.
* Requires you have `gfind` installed (`brew install gfind`), otherwise replace `gfind` with `find` in the script.

To try and save you disk space, the script will already trim the data down a lot, reducing the corpus size by about 66%:

* Clones repos only with `--depth 1`
* Deletes the entire `.git` directory after cloning repos, so only file contents are left. This reduces the corpus size by about 30% (412G -> 290G, for 12,148 repos) 
* Deleting files greater than 1MB. GitHub only indexes files smaller than 384KB, for example - and this 1MB limit reduces the corpus size by _another_ whopping 51% (290G -> 142G, for 12,148 repos) - wow.

You can use this command at any time to figure out how many repos have been cloned:

```sh
echo "progress: $(find ../corpus/ -maxdepth 4 -mindepth 4 | wc -l) repos cloned"
```

## Setting up Docker

If you plan on using Docker and are on Mac OS, you are using a VM and this has performance implications. Be sure to:

1. Max out the CPUs, Memory, and disk space available to Docker.
2. Disable "Use gRPC FUSE for file sharing" in Experimental Features.

## Initializing Postgres

Launch Postgres via `./run-postgres.sh`, and then get a `psql` prompt:

```sh
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres
```

Create the DB schema:

```sql
BEGIN;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS files (
    id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
    contents text NOT NULL,
    filepath text NOT NULL
);
COMMIT;
```

## Indexing the corpus

Index a single repository:

```sh
DATABASE=postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres go run ./cmd/corpusindex/main.go ../corpus/c/github.com\\/linux-noah\\/noah/
```

Index all repositories:

```sh
go install ./cmd/corpusindex; DATABASE=postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres ./index-corpus.sh
```

## Querying the corpus

```
postgres=# SELECT filepath FROM files WHERE contents ~ 'use strict';
                                   filepath                                    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ../corpus/c/github.com\/linux-noah\/noah/.git/hooks/fsmonitor-watchman.sample
(1 row)
```

This will take around ~8 hours on a 2020 Macbook Pro i9 w/ 16G memory.

On-disk size of the entire DB at this point will be 101G.

## Create the Trigram index

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS files_contents_trgm_idx ON files USING GIN (contents gin_trgm_ops);
```

### Configuration attempt 1 (indexing failure, OOM)

With this configuration, the above `CREATE INDEX` command will take `11h34m` and ultimately OOM and fail:

```
listen_addresses = '*'
max_connections = 100
shared_buffers = 4GB
effective_cache_size = 12GB
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_buffers = 16MB
default_statistics_target = 100
random_page_cost = 1.1
effective_io_concurrency = 200
work_mem = 5242kB
min_wal_size = 50GB
max_wal_size = 4GB
max_worker_processes = 8
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 8
max_parallel_workers = 8
max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8
```

```
postgres=# CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS files_contents_trgm_idx ON files USING GIN (contents gin_trgm_ops);

server closed the connection unexpectedly
	This probably means the server terminated abnormally
	before or while processing the request.
The connection to the server was lost. Attempting reset: Failed.
```

Postgres logs indicate:

```

No postgres _container_ restart will be observed because (interestingly) Postgres can handle the OOM without restarting the container and start itself again. One of the benefits of handling C allocation failures, I presume, but didn't investigate:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
eb087868cb00        postgres:13.1-alpine   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   43 hours ago        Up 43 hours         127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp   postgres
```

See `docker_stats_logs/configuration-failure-1.log` for a JSON log stream of container `docker stats` captured during the `CREATE INDEX`.

There is evidence that indexing with that configuration -- for whatever reason -- for the vast majority of indexing time uses just 1-2 CPU cores, and peak ~11 GiB of memory according to `docker stats`.

### Configuration attempt 2 (24h+ of indexing, then out of disk space)

For this attempt, we use a configuration provided by pgtune for a data warehouse with 10G memory to reduce the chance of OOMs:

```
# DB Version: 13
# OS Type: linux
# DB Type: dw
# Total Memory (RAM): 10 GB
# CPUs num: 8
# Connections num: 20
# Data Storage: ssd

max_connections = 20
shared_buffers = 2560MB
effective_cache_size = 7680MB
maintenance_work_mem = 1280MB
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_buffers = 16MB
default_statistics_target = 500
random_page_cost = 1.1
effective_io_concurrency = 200
work_mem = 16MB
min_wal_size = 4GB
max_wal_size = 16GB
max_worker_processes = 8
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4
max_parallel_workers = 8
max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 4
```

Indexing took `~26h54m`, compared to the `~11h34m` in the previous attempt, starting at 2:39pm and ending at ~5:31pm the next day in an out-of-space failure.

See `docker_stats_logs/configuration-failure-2.log` for a full JSON stream of `docker stats` during indexing.

See `logs/configuration-failure-2.log` for the Postgres logs during this attempt.

Of particular note is that, again, almost 100% of the time was spent with a single CPU core maxed out and the vast majority of the CPU in `Idle` state (red).

Memory pressure was mostly fine and remained under 75%:

<img width="597" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106506305-c5b06880-6486-11eb-9aef-0a0f086fa623.png">

Memory usage (purple == compressed, red==active, blue==wired) shows we never hit memory limits or even high usage:

<img width="594" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106506397-e5479100-6486-11eb-93eb-a4488efb15b9.png">

The `docker stats` stream (`docker_stats_logs/configuration-failure-2.log`) shows memory usage throughout the 24h+ period never going above ~1.4G.

Despite this, system swap was used somewhat heavily:

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106507665-9ac71400-6488-11eb-839f-13e0369865d2.png">

Disk usage during indexing tells us that the average was about ~250 MB/s for reads (blue) and writes (red):

<img width="599" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106507903-ec6f9e80-6488-11eb-88a8-78e5b7aacfd6.png">

It should be noted that in-software disk speed tests (i.e. including disk encryption Mac OS is performing) show regular read and write speeds of ~860 MB/s with <5% effect on CPU usage:

<img width="591" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106508609-d8786c80-6489-11eb-92c7-b69db1ee1daa.png">

It should also be noted that postgres disk usage during this test, although eventually running out, rose from `101G` to `124G`:

```
$ du -sh .postgres/
124G	.postgres/
```

### Configuration attempt 3: reduced dataset

For this attempt, and to reduce the turnaround time on experiments, we use the same postgres configuration as in attempt 2 but we use a reduced dataset. Before we had 19,441,820 files totalling ~178.2 GiB:

```
postgres=# select count(filepath) from files;
  count   
----------
 19441820
(1 row)

postgres=# select SUM(octet_length(contents)) from files;
     sum      
--------------
 191379114802
(1 row)
```

We drop half the files in the dataset, and :

```
postgres=# select count(filepath) from files;
  count  
---------
 9720910
(1 row)

postgres=# select SUM(octet_length(contents)) from files;
     sum     
-------------
 88123563320
(1 row)
```

Now 82 GiB of raw text are to be indexed.

And we free ~228G for use by the Postgres indexing (previously ~15G.)

Index creation this time took from 3:14pm MST to 7:44pm MST (next day), a total of 28h30m. However, for some period of this time the Macbook went into low-power (not sleep) mode for - approx 6h - making actual indexing time around ~22h.

Total Postgres data size afterwards (again, less than 82 GiB due to compression):

```
$ du -sh .postgres/
 73G	.postgres/
```

(We did not take measurements through the Mac app for indexing this time.)

## Query performance

Restart Postgres first, such that its memory caches are emptied.

Once it starts, capture docker stats:

```sh
OUT=docker_stats_logs/query-run-n.log ./capture-docker-stats.sh
```

Set a query timeoout of 5 minutes on the database:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET statement_timeout = '300s';
```

Then begin querying the corpus:

```sh
./query-corpus.sh
```

## Query performance

We started queries at 12:42PM MST using:

```
./query-corpus.sh &> query_logs/query-run-1.log
```

- Find the exact SQL queries we ran in `query_logs/query-run-1.log`.
- Find the `docker stats` measured during query execution in `docker_stats_logs/query-run-1.log`.

CPU usage (150% == one and a half cores) during query execution as visualized by:

### Database startup time

Clean startups are almost instantaneous, taking less than a second. 

If the DB is not shut down correctly (i.e. previously terminated during startup), startup takes a fairly hefty 10m12s to complete before the DB will accept any connections, as it begins a recovery process (which I assume involves reading a substantial portion of the DB from disk):
